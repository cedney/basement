Azure AD Connect (AAD Connect) February 2016 Build (1.1.105.0) Onwards
In February 2016 build 1.1.105.0 of Azure AD Connect was released which introduced multiple new features.  The scheduler is now built into the sync engine.  This means that there is no longer a separate DirectorySyncClientCmd tool.

To initiate a Delta Sync, open Windows PowerShell and run:

Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta

force sync

Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial

Set-Mailbox -Identity [user id here] -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $true
 To initiate a Full Sync, open Windows PowerShell and run:

Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial

Pierre added a comment indicating that if the commands are not visible, try to load up the PowerShell module:

Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync\ADSync.psd1"
