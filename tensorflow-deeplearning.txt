Installing tensorflow
First, create a project directory called tf-demo:
$ mkdir ~/tf-demo
Navigate to your newly created tf-demo directory:
$ cd ~/tf-demo
Then create a new virtual environment called tensorflow-dev. Run the following command to create the environment:
$ sudo apt-get install python3 venv

$ python3 -m venv tensorflow-dev
This creates a new tensorflow-dev directory which will contain all of the packages that you install while this environment is activated. It also includes pip and a standalone version of Python.

Now activate your virtual environment:

$ source tensorflow-dev/bin/activate

Once activated, you will see something similar to this in your terminal:

(tensorflow-dev)username@hostname:~/tf-demo $
Now you can install TensorFlow in your virtual environment.

Run the following command to install and upgrade to the newest version of TensorFlow available in PyPi:

(tensorflow-dev) $ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

TensorFlow will install:

If you'd like to deactivate your virtual environment at any time, the command is:

deactivate
To reactivate the environment later, navigate to your project directory and run source tensorflow-dev/bin/activate.
