# Turn off tensorflow warning messages in program output
os.environ[ 'TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'

#Define computational graph
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="X")
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="Y")

addition = tf.add(X, Y, name="addition")

#Create the session
with tf.Session() as session:

      result = session.run(addition, feed_dict={X: [1], Y: [4]})
      we can feed in multiple numbers for x and y and have them added

      result = session.run(addition, feed_dict={X: [1, 10, 1980, 54], Y:[100, 76, 3, 6754],)

      print(result)

   ####   results would be [ 101, 86, 1983, 6808]
